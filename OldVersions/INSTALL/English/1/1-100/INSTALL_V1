Installing Tetrsi128
---

Tetris128 currently can't be installed, as it is not production ready (or functional) yet. The project uses multiple engines for different editions. You can choose between 4 engines:

Tetris128 Python engine (Linux, MacOS, BSD, Windows) x64 & x128

Tetris128 C++ engine (Android, iOS, Linux, MacOS, BSD, Windows) x64 x x128

Tetris128 Rust engine (Linux, MacOS, BSD, Windows) x64

Tetris128 GDScript (GoDot) engine (Linux, MacOS, BSD, Windows) x64

When the project is ready, you will need a high end computer to run the game (high-end, as in, the top home computer of 2021) although the game is 128 bit, it can also be ran on 64 bit systems. 63 bit systems and lower (including 32 bit) are not supported (because the game is too powerful to run on these platforms, and it isn't worth maintaining a 32 bit version)

More documentation is coming soon.
