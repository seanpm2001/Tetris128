These 4 pages were of interest to me in late 2023 December. I am going to try and apply this new knowledge to further development of this project.

- https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/208367/how-is-rotation-defined-in-a-tetris-game
- https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/197273/is-it-plausible-for-tetris-to-be-running-at-around-250-fps-on-a-laptop
- https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/203919/how-to-move-blocks-down-to-fill-the-gap-after-clearing-a-row-in-tetris
- https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/155199/tetris-smooth-piece-drop-c

Images have been included separately to prevent link rot destroying this new knowledge.
