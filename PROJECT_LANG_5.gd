# I chose GDScript (GoDot Script) as the fifth project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Tetris128) as GDScript is one of the languages this project uses heavily (it has an engine written in the language) and I wanted to have a project language file to represent it. GoDot is used for better cross platform support until the other engines are ready, and also just to have a GoDot version of the program.
