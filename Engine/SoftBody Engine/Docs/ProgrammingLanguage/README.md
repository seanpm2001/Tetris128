# Programming language

I originally intended to write this entire games engine in Python, but I feel this may be impossible. So right now, I chose 3 different engines:

* Pytris - The original Python engine for Softbody Tetris

* RustTris - The original Python engine ported to Rust, as Rust is a very powerful language and may be more well suited for this project.

* TetrisPlusPlus - The original RUst engine ported to C++, as C++ is also a very powerful language and may be more well suited for this project.

I need advice on what engine should be the main. The main goals for the softbody engine is stability and lightness.
