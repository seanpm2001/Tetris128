# Tetris128 in 3D

These sections need to be split off into their own documents.

I have been researching 3D versions of Tetris recently (up to 2023, Monday, February 20th) and I find them to be interesting and feel they should be added to this project.

## Modes

### 3D Normal

Just a normal game of Tetris, but in 3D instead of 2D/2.5D.

**This section is a major stub, and need significant expansion.**

### 3D Party Mix

Tetris party mix (Minoes, Dominoes, Trominoes, Tetrominoes, Pentominoes, Hexominoes, Septominoes, Octominoes, Nonominoes, and Decominoes) all mixed together and in 3D.
